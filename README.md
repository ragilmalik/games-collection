## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** you're interested in
2. **Upload to your hosting** (Hostinger shared hosting works great)
3. **Access via browser** - Most games are self-contained HTML/JS files
4. **No build process needed** - Most repositories can be deployed as-is

## Hosting Tips for Hostinger

- Upload files to `public_html` directory
- Ensure `.htaccess` allows serving of `.js` and `.html` files
- Most games are client-side only, requiring no server configuration
- Consider organizing games in subdirectories for better management
